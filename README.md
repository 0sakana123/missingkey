## About this fork
- **Based on modern Misskey v13**\
MissingKey is based on Misskey 13.6.1 and you can use almost features of that!
- **Simpler and easier to use**\
MissingKey is easy to use, because it has minimized the extra features added in later versions (mainly for me).
- **Small scale specialized**\
Setting up a system intended for a large scale is complicated. MissingKey, which is primarily intended for use by small groups, requires no unnecessary configuration.
- **Finally...**\
It is better to have a text that is more conscious, so I have included a text that looks like it xD
- And much more...
